# ⚡ Visualization Tool for Electric Vehicle Charge and Range Analysis

> A data analytics dashboard created using Tableau to visualize and understand patterns in EV charging behavior and vehicle range, aimed at supporting strategic decisions in sustainable transport.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) charging and range data using MySQL and Tableau. Our interactive dashboard and storyboards provide insights into key metrics such as vehicle efficiency, charge duration, battery status, and travel patterns to promote better energy consumption and planning in the EV ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze EV usage and performance data.
- Visualize charging behavior and battery range.
- Support informed decisions for EV drivers and manufacturers.
- Enable data-driven insights using Tableau dashboards.

## 📌 Dashboard Components

11 Tableau sheets were created and integrated into a dashboard and story. Here's what each sheet contributes:

1. **Charge Duration per Vehicle**  
   Shows how long different EVs spend charging.

2. **Distance Travelled vs. Battery Used**  
   Compares the range efficiency of each EV.

3. **Battery SOC Level over Time**  
   Visualizes how state of charge changes with usage.

4. **Charge Sessions by Hour**  
   Helps identify peak charging hours.

5. **Energy Consumption Distribution**  
   Displays power usage trends per trip.

6. **EV Range Cluster Map**  
   Clusters EVs based on charge-distance patterns.

7. **Average Charging Time per Station**  
   Finds efficiency of different locations.

8. **Battery Health by Vehicle Type**  
   Highlights battery degradation by category.

9. **Top Performing EV Models**  
   Ranks EVs based on charge efficiency.

10. **Charging Frequency vs. Usage**  
    Analyzes user dependency on charging infrastructure.

11. **Overall Summary**  
    A compiled visual of all major KPIs.

## 📖 Storyboard Flow

The Tableau Story summarizes:
- Intro to EV usage data
- Stepwise interpretation of each KPI
- Decision-support narrative for EV stakeholders

---

## 🧠 Design Process

- **Empathy Mapping**: Identified user pain points like range anxiety and charge time confusion.
- **Problem Statement**: EV users lack clarity in understanding usage patterns and battery efficiency.
- **Brainstorming**: Explored solutions like range mapping, charge alerts, and data visualization.
- **Solution Architecture**: Used MySQL to store/query raw data, Tableau to design visuals.

---

## ✅ Performance Highlights

- 100% real-time insights from raw SQL data
- Fast visual load time in Tableau
- Filtered, drill-down analytics for individual EVs

## 🌐 Web Bootstrap Integration

We integrated **Bootstrap 5** to build a responsive and modern web interface for our project. This allowed us to present the Tableau dashboards seamlessly and enhance user experience.

### 🔧 Features Implemented Using Bootstrap:
- Responsive grid layout that adjusts across screen sizes
- Navigation bar, content sections, and cards using Bootstrap components
- Mobile-friendly embedding of Tableau visualizations
- Smooth scroll, padding, and layout styling with Bootstrap utilities
